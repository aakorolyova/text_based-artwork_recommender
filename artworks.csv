The practice of Cameron Jamie b 1969 USA has a distinct place of its own in the contemporary art scene Through a wide range of media performance video sculpture installation photography and drawing his work embodies an ongoing investigation into the unselfconscious folklore of suburban culture exploring marginal realities amateur and vernacular traditions and revealing a hidden face of our society Jamie s ceramic sculptures are formed from organic hand molded shapes and pieces through repeated firing and glazing the structures are glossed in an animated surface pattern of swirling lava varnishes with spectacular richness The material exploration on display demonstrates the artist s ability to traverse the conventional and experimental at once re imagining recognizable forms and expanding the discourse of ceramic and monotype ,Azteka
Juan Usl paintings are complex interactions and incorporate a great diversity of art historical references sensory and mental impressions various pictorial languages the gesture of painting and how the matter paints itself functions The first step is the canvas s preparation with multiple layers of gesso which is a key element that will remain visible This continuous manifestation of the gesso also conveys a philosophical resonance for Usl namely that the beginning is present at the end that the painting is a self contained entity a complete object not merely within its four sides but in the vertical layering of its surface as well The process of painting consists of a natural harmony between the manual act and the intellectual decisions Movement or even better displacement is a thematic key in his work In Usl s work we can read a constant dichotomy between opposing and complementary elements at the same time order and chaos presence and absence flatness and depth Most of his paintings are a juxtaposition of color areas and lines structures that seem to come and go like the fragments of a story The Artist presents his work as a temporary delimitation of infinite surfaces or as fragments from an infinite structure of lines Particularly well known is the series of paintings called So que Revelabas Dream that revelead In these works the artist through a deeply introspective practice seems to give shape to his more intimate self While painting Usl tries to connect rhythmically with his palpitation making each stroke a symbolic representation of the beating of his heart return the theme of disorientation no longer understood only in a physical sense but also and above all in a more temporal and perceptive way His paintings take the viewer into a labyrinthine space in which the articulation seems to indicate a specific direction while paradoxically it leaves open the way to interpretation ,Soñé que revelabas (Karnali)

Jonathan Meese b 1970 Tokyo appeared on the international art scene back in 1998 and is now one of the contemporary art world s most enigmatic seductive and rebellious figures He is renowned for his multi faceted work including wildly exuberant paintings that mix personal hieroglyphics and collage installations ecstatic performances and a powerful body of sculptures in a variety of media At the core of his work remains an unrelenting sense of history based on intimate drawings symbols and objects which form the mythological universe of his life s work drawing in the innocent by stander almost by force ,"""BABY ""CAMELOT"" (BEHIND THE WHEEL)"""

Marisa Merz 1925 2019 Italy was one of the key personalities and the only woman associated with the Arte Povera movement in the late 60s and 70s Known for the unusual use of materials such as copper wire clay and wax the sculptures and drawings of Merz reflect her poetic sensibility and vision for art and life By employing abstract organic figures Merz creates familiar portraits and sculptures which insist on subjectiveness while emitting both a constantly changing message as well as the artist s belief that every shape is fluid and should be able to transform into any other shape Merz does not distinguish between art and life employing handcraft and unconventional materials in order to explore the infinite possibilities of everyday life while in many cases she adopts traditional techniques associated with the female domestic environment such as knitting The idea of home acting as a sphere engulfing privacy familiarity and female concepts is one of the central references to her work ,Untitled

LIANG Wei b 1981 China is one of China s most original new voices in contemporary painting Her work takes apart imagery of urban environments architecture machinery cinema and classical art to reassemble them into fantastical compositions that suggest an alternative physical plane of existence These meticulous compositions look abstract at first glance but the eye quickly starts to discern familiar shapes and structures that form new narratives in the mind of the viewer The lack of focal point or rather seemingly multiple focal points of her paintings suggest classical Chinese landscapes in which physical space is painted from both the perspective of the viewer and people in the composition The eye follows the narrative but also explores the landscape as it does so In a similar fashion when faced with Liang Wei s works the viewer s eye is guided to different points in the composition by the structure and energy of the brush strokes making discoveries as it does so The extremely detailed nature of Liang Wei work necessitates a long creative process The compositions are grown organically out of chaos but resolve in a sense of equilibrium Many stories seem to be hidden behind the clusters of shapes waiting to burst out from the explosion of brush strokes Her work like contemporary society attempts to build utopian visions out of dystopian realities ,Imagined Decision
Giancarlo Scaglia b 1981 Peru studied Visual Arts in Lima where he developed his career as an artist Scaglia s work reinterpretates social conflicts from the 80 s and the 90 s in Peru His interest for the recontextualization of these events in the arts brought him to question the origin of the artistic vanguards and to reflect about what determinates whether an action or a gesture is considered art ,Golden Aérea 2
Thomas Sch tte s b 1954 Germany work develops in many different areas architectural models installations watercolors banners sculptures in different scales etchings are some of the most expressive mediums the artist uses during the last years Sch tte generates a personal collection of techniques and styles from which draws its material every time He believes that form material and color have their own language which is impossible to translate A few of the issues that concern the artist and are subjects of his work are the problems that contemporary man faces with oneself living with others confronting the present facing his mortality His work is often ironic and critical at the same time ,"""Blumenoval"""
Farida El Gazzar s vintage framed dreamy landscapes of night gardens invite the viewer on a journey of meditation and self reflection They are a peaceful oasis in the emotional desert of modern day life Born in Alexandria and based in Athens El Gazzar draws often inspiration from Egypt artists like David Hockney Thomas Demand and Karen Kilimnik manuscripts byzantine icons from Arab literature and the poetry of C P Cavafy As the artist states about the Nght Garden series Then there is this silence that begins with dusk and evolves into a more magical place to a night that grows It illuminates and magnifies through the stark light that peaks through and draws you into its world Within this discovery is a parallel existence of curiosity and imagination There is a feeling of something hidden waiting to be revealed and acknowledged Yet it only lasts for a brief moment as it is ephemeral Knowing that you have little time to find it makes you anticipate to come back to look for more You can hear your thoughts now and feel your emotions You find yourself in these gardens that night paints and you know somewhat that you are safe again Short Biography Farida El Gazzar was born in 1975 in Alexandria Egypt She is a Greek Egyptian artist based in Athens From 2003 to 2007 she was co founder of the creative team WARDA Her ongoing relationship with the Middle East is a result of her early years in Alexandria and Kuwait and has been realized more recently through her residencies and research in Cairo and Manama Recent Exhibitions Art d Egypt 2019 and 2018 Cairo Opening Remarks Athr Gallery Jeddah 2018 Art Basel Miami solo show in Kabinett section with Kalfayan Galleries 2017 and NP or the Possibilities of Life locus Athens Athens Dream City Gypsum Gallery Cairo 2015 Arabic Without A Teacher Kerameikos Athens Ofthalmofanes Technopolis Athens all 2010 Rehang curators November Paynter and Sylvia Kouvali parallel event to the 11th International Istanbul Biennial Grand Hotal De Londres Istanbul Thirty Posters on Migration IMEPO Hellenic Migration Policy Institute Syntagma Metro Station Athens The Ultimate Experience Al Riwaq Gallery Bahrain all 2009 ,It Isn’t True

Giovanni Anselmo s work derives inspiration from the observation of natural events from the energy inherent in the natural world It represents these forces with a constant reference to an other place or to an infinity that that same natural world creates with reference to man The understanding of the natural has led Giovanni Anselmo to give shape to incredible yet intrinsically ancient events such as the elevation of weight in space the curvature of a surface on a plane or the contortion of material on a base The results are sculptures in which you notice a compressed strength ready to explode ready to break out in every direction Yet it is not an evolving energy rather it is frozen at its limits in a moment of equilibrium ,Senza Titolo
THE BEARD PICTURES series was first presented in 2017 at Galleria Alfonso Artiaco in honor of the 50th anniversary of the artists first meeting THE BEARD PICTURES are violent eerie grotesque lurid and crazed They show a dream like world of paranoia destruction and madness Their strange sickly colors and creeping smashed up absurd landscapes confront the viewer with relentless aggression THE BEARD PICTURES depict a world bereft of reason in which negotiation no longer exists In this piece the artists stand either in front of a barbed wire or mesh fence ora behind one Behind them a blank silvery void extravagant ornamental foliage They wear beards that are surreal and symbolic Beards made of wire mesh beards made of bear foam beards made of flowers Aggressively absurd trashing contemporary artistic niceties but resonant with intense symbolism THE BEARD PICTURES turn history into a mad parade their mood shape shifting between that of science fiction lucid dreaming and Victorian caricature It is a vision and a form which brings to mind Oscar Wilde s account of Walter Pater s Essays Secular and sacred the throwback emblem of hip millennial youth as well as a mark of religious faith the beard is depicted in this work as booth mask and meaning a sign of the times ,PLANE BEARD
Since the late 1960s Lavier has created a complex and eclectic universe based on the continuous exploration of the boundaries between painting and sculpture photography and painting reality and imagination the copy and the original Through light hearted humor and sarcasm Lavier has reworked the notion of the canvas and moreover of the art work in general via juxtapositions and hybridizations creations that are generated by his thoughts on consumerism and authorship With his well known intervention the Van Gogh technique the artist applies a thick layer of impasto on ordinary objects like a piano a radio a refrigerator transforming them from everyday objects into works of art Lavier is a persistent explorer of reality through his artworks he challenges and questions the notion of the identity of the artist and the relationship between the artists ego and the rest of the world each work of his is a sardonic dare towards the insufferable codes and rules of the art system and of contemporary culture ,"""IFFAFA 3"""

LIANG Wei b 1981 China is one of China s most original new voices in contemporary painting Her work takes apart imagery of urban environments architecture machinery cinema and classical art to reassemble them into fantastical compositions that suggest an alternative physical plane of existence These meticulous compositions look abstract at first glance but the eye quickly starts to discern familiar shapes and structures that form new narratives in the mind of the viewer The lack of focal point or rather seemingly multiple focal points of her paintings suggest classical Chinese landscapes in which physical space is painted from both the perspective of the viewer and people in the composition The eye follows the narrative but also explores the landscape as it does so In a similar fashion when faced with Liang Wei s works the viewer s eye is guided to different points in the composition by the structure and energy of the brush strokes making discoveries as it does so The extremely detailed nature of Liang Wei work necessitates a long creative process The compositions are grown organically out of chaos but resolve in a sense of equilibrium Many stories seem to be hidden behind the clusters of shapes waiting to burst out from the explosion of brush strokes Her work like contemporary society attempts to build utopian visions out of dystopian realities ,Synchronized Emotion

Since the late 1960s Lavier has created a complex and eclectic universe based on the continuous exploration of the boundaries between painting and sculpture photography and painting reality and imagination the copy and the original Through light hearted humor and sarcasm Lavier has reworked the notion of the canvas and moreover of the art work in general via juxtapositions and hybridizations creations that are generated by his thoughts on consumerism and authorship With his well known intervention the Van Gogh technique the artist applies a thick layer of impasto on ordinary objects like a piano a radio a refrigerator transforming them from everyday objects into works of art Lavier is a persistent explorer of reality through his artworks he challenges and questions the notion of the identity of the artist and the relationship between the artists ego and the rest of the world each work of his is a sardonic dare towards the insufferable codes and rules of the art system and of contemporary culture ,"""Gard"""

Susan Rothenberg was born in Buffalo New York in 1945 Her early works that came to prominence in the 1970s New York art world were mainly large acrylic figurative paintings of horses Since the 1990s her works are mostly reflections of her move from New York to New Mexico Rothenberg adopts oil painting and she finds a new interest in using the memory of observed and experienced events a riding accident a near fatal bee sting walking the dog a game of poker or dominoes as a source of inspiration for creating a painting With the use of thickly layered and intense brushwork her paintings acquire life and depict scenes from everyday life eIther an unpleasant event or a moment of remembrance A distinctive element also of these works is a tilted perspective which attributes to the work an eerily objective psychological edge ,Primo
Hyun Sook Song born in 1952 in Damyang Jeollanam do KR lives and works in Hamburg DE Hyun Sook Song grew up in a mountain village in Korea In 1972 she travelled to West Germany and soon after that she began to draw and to paint In doing so she often gave voice to her nostalgic memories of her beloved motherland Over several decades she created paintings with only a handful of motifs or themes clay pots silk ribbons draped around posts or woven textiles hung on a thread Song developed both a very distinctive style and a technique that blends elements from the West and the East She chose to use tempera a type of paint made by mixing pigments with egg yolk This technique was widely used in Western painting in the Middle Ages notably because of the paint s opaque character Song by contrast uses tempera in a way that is almost transparent the brushstrokes are economical but accurate Each brushstroke represents a single movement and there is no room for doubt Her artistic outlook has been heavily influenced by Eastern philosophy and calligraphy but also by her love of nature the body and her materials She sees painting as a performative happening She places the stretched canvas on the floor of her studio and balances above the painting on a simple wooden plank that is placed above it In doing so she is in a state of utter concentration and meditation The intensity of the painting enables her to work for only a few hours per day This does not prevent her from going to the studio every day to maintain her dexterity Although her formal language may be limited the variations appear endless The works can be approached from both an abstract meditative perspective and a figurative symbolic viewpoint The wooden poles refer to a simple form of shelter while the fabrics often suggest the age old tradition of ramie weaving in the region of her birth The paint that thins out as the line progresses symbolizes the finiteness of life and the dying out of hope A brushstroke is the ultimate proof of the painter s inner peace or turmoil and is always expressive In addition the brushstroke is always unique because the relation with the surface the scale and the light is always different Further proof of the importance of the brushstroke in Song s oeuvre is the fact that her titles are based on the number of movements that she needed to complete the work Hyun Sook Song s works can be compared to haiku short and simple but very powerful in terms of content ,7 Brushstrokes
Kees Goudzwaard born in 1958 in Utrecht NL lives and works in Antwerp BE At first sight the paintings by Kees Goudzwaard seem to be minimal colour studies constructed from rectangles of paper and masking tape but in fact only paint was used The artist first constructs a model using paper sheets transparent acetates and tape arranged over a coloured ground It often takes long periods of time before he arrives at the final composition then he transfers the exact same image to the canvas Paper and tape are thus used as substitutes for colour fields and lines The obsession of modernist painting with flatness and the negation of illusory space are of great interest to the artist His paintings challenge the borderline between abstraction illusion and reference to reality They are about painting construction of an image layer by layer ,Cultivation
Mircea Suciu born in 1978 in Baia Mare RO lives and works in Cluj RO Mircea Suciu works with different materials such as acrylic oil and often combines them with monoprint techniques For a long time his works were based on images he found in newspapers magazines and other media The themes he choses are mainly socio political and psychological orientated The artist has a particular interest in the way the individual appropriates the behaviour of the mass during manifestations and therefore loses his own identity Recently elements such as props curtains covered objects and people struggling with heavy entities like big balloons have appeared in his new works For Mircea Suciu the process is at least equally important as the final image He likes to work in series in order to exhaust the imagery and to transform them in a way that the viewer gets different perspectives on a certain topic Since last year he started making his own photographs so that he can combine different realities and visuals in one work Despite a complex and layered creation process the surface of each work has a unified quality Suciu envisions works that are difficult to define in time and space By using a staged process of creation destruction and restoration his surfaces seem to have suffered and give the impression of embodying an intense history Painting is a loaded and heavy medium that Mircea Suciu wants to honour This implicates a dialogue with the past but also with the future because as an artist he searches for new areas in painting by pushing limits and possibilities and looking for a position of his own in a contemporary world filled with new media ,Dazzle (Hallucination / Disintegration)

The sculpture Sea Glass Equilibrium 2019 was inspired by the specific settings of the UCCA Dune Museum in Qinhuangdao While entering the rooms of the museum Chan noticed the ocean horizon behind the full glass window and she started conceiving a sculpture that responded to this unique environment Like all of her sculptures it started from an object found sitting by the dumpster across her studio two pieces of L shaped glass plates once components of a furniture piece Their colour was evocative of the hues of the ocean and reminiscent of a sea glass resurfacing from sea waters In the sculpture the two glass pieces are facing each other creating a sense of balance Two seashells are precariously resting between the two L shaped glass plates held together by two small concrete sculptures casted from plastic egg package containers Their shape recalls those of barnacles marine creatures living attached to rocks in the sea The fragile qualities of the egg packaging create a curious contrast to their negative counterpart the hard shell barnacles casted in hard weighted concrete They are in a state of equilibrium while bringing awareness to the horizon in the background At the same time multiple concrete forms are attached to and grow organically from the base of the sculpture like sea barnacles in their natural environment The round edged shape and the marine colour of the sculpture recall the glass that is worn down by waves and rocks Sea glass originates as pieces of glass from broken bottles dumped into the ocean which are rolled and tumbled in the ocean for years until all of their edges are rounded off It turns into a precious object that people collect and may even become a common DIY interior decor material making its way back into human home ,Seaglass Equilibrium

Micha l Borremans born 1963 in Geraardsbergen BE lives and works Ghent BE The films paintings and drawings by Belgian artist Micha l Borremans overwhelm the viewer through the use of deceleration precision and vortex His seductive works contain timeless images of inner drive and external force of the latent pressure involved in being human Behind a veil of stylistic perfection the artist simulates common rituals of interpretation and meaning His intensely atmospheric images are puzzles involving political and psychological patterns of perceiving the world which oscillate in a camouflaging fragile way between inexorable realism and nebulous distance Micha l Borremans created his new painting The Provider 2019 especially for the exhibition Convex Concave Belgian Contemporary Art at TANK in Shanghai curated by Dirk Snauwaert from WIELS in Brussels ,The Provider
Mark Manders born in 1968 in Volkel NL lives and works in Ronse BE The work of Mark Manders resembles a fictional building divided into separate rooms and levels of which the size and shape can never exactly be determined Potential shifts and extensions constantly threaten the cohesion of the ever expanding self portrait Manders works toward one big overarching moment that will bring together all his works continuously interconnected and in dialogue with each other As a sculptor Manders adheres to the tradition of bronze sculpture yet also incorporates contemporary materials in his work Blurring the line between reality and illusion it often becomes difficult to distinguish when Manders is actually integrating natural wood or just a painted wood imitation This also applies to the androgynous figures or faces that seem to have been fashioned out of wet clay creating the impression that they just left the artist s studio or conversely were abandoned by the artist mid work The illusion of peeling dry clay creates a sense of foreboding as if the sculpture could crumble into fine dust and disappear at any time There appears to be a definite separation between the sculpture and the person who realized it as if it was abandoned by its creator or could not be completed ,Unfired Clay Torso
